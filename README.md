# SQL-Data-Cleaning-Nashville-Housing

In this project I will be working with some Nashville Housing Data in an Excel Workbook and then loading that data into Azure Data Studio and cleaning the data making it better for data analysis. This is not an end to end project, I will not be analyzing the data but just cleaning it so it could be analyzed
